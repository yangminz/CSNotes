# Probability Review

**A random experiment**: A physical procedure whose outcome is not known beforehand. E.g., rolling a dice, flipping a coin, applying to a job, going to DMV, etc.

3 components of a probability experiment

1.  **Sample Space** $\Omega$: The set of all possible outcomes $\omega$ of the experiment. E.g., flip a coin: $\Omega = \{H,T\}$.
2.  **Event Space** $\mathcal{F}$: A family of subsetsof $\Omega$, where each member of $\mathcal{F}$ is called an *event*. An event $A \subseteq \Omega$ represents a *binary* observation made during the experiment. Observer $A$ of experiment result: $A$ has occured (outcome $\omega \in A$); $A$ has not occured (outcome $\omega \notin A$).
