## What is Blockchain

By Sir John Hargrave, Evan Karnoupakis

The simple definition: the internet of money. Money: not only cash, also stocks, etc. Internet: share info, blockchain: share value. Share money ~= send email.

Send money: transaction to a block of data, then add block to a chain of other blocks.

```
Transaction 1 ---> Transaction 2 ---> Transaction 3
```

Block: transactions; chain: the sequence of transactions

## Bitcoin: The 'Big Bang' of Blockchain

E-Cash: paper money to digital money.

Mine: contribute computing power to the network ==> earn bitcoin.

Realworkd value: use bitcoin to buy pizzas. inside community

Have a good origin story.

wherever value is flowing, potential opportunity for blockchain.

## How Bitcoin Works

P2P Money: money can be sent between users, without having to go through a central bank.

digital wallet: online banking account: public key (like email address) & private key (like password). 

Node: a single computer within a blockchain netwwork.

bitcoin software: decentralizing the network. No one owns the network so no one could shut it down.

Decentralized: shared among nodes, no central authority. 

## The Decentralized Ledger

Money has value, and that value needs to be recorded somewhere. Pay 1 million dollars, need a receipt. 

accounting ledgers: excel, checkbook, etc., anywhere keep track of money. A central repo for all accounting data (inflows & outflows). Blockchain use decentralized accounting ledgers - pro: more trustworthy; con: lots of coordination.

decentralized ledger: massive shared database spread across hundreds of nodes. 

Blockchain is a different method of accounting: `[Alice, -, 1M] --> [Bob, +, 1M]` -- a immutable record of Alice's transfer to Bob.

Consensus: E.g., DNS system: a website can be up and running within 24 hours, thousands of independent DNS servers, internet nodes that check and agree with one another.

Consensus: the algorithm of nodes agree: source, destination, amount.

P2P file sharing + decentralized ledger technology. 

## Blockchain Is a Platform

Blockchain is a platform for sharing value.

Altcoins: Alternatives to bincoin, cryptocurrencies, e.g., Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin. The value is directly correlated with the number of people using a blockchain. 

Where do my stakeholders need to share value? Units of value -- coins or tokens. 

> What the first explosion of altcoins taught us is that blockchain projects will have the best chance of user adoption if users perceive they are receiving something of value. In other words, even if you don’t call them money, think about them like money.

**KEY TAKEAWAYS**

- Blockchain is the Internet of Money, a new platform for sharing value.
- Bitcoin was the first—and still the most successful—project built on blockchain.
- Altcoins (alternatives to bitcoin) quickly followed, sometimes called "cryptocurrencies," "coins," or "tokens."
- These new types of "money" or "value" are typically shared peer-to-peer, without a central bank.
- Likewise, we keep track of them using distributed ledgers: an accounting system spread across a worldwide network of computers.
- Technology leaders face two primary challenges: getting people to understand blockchain (that’s why we’re here), and getting people to use their blockchain (that’s why you’re here).
- Creating a blockchain is like creating a mini-economy. Mastering the building blocks of blockchain is what you’ll learn next.

## Blockchain Building Blocks

Vitalik Buterin: Ethereum, a simple scripting language allow create new blockchain apps. The money, Ether.

### The Beating Heart of Blockchain

Blockchain: many copies, many computers. Decentralized Ledger Technology (DLT) is different from cloud computing. (Excel, Google Sheet (cloud computing but centralized), DLT).

> Decentralized ledger technology: The beating heart of blockchain. It allows us to keep all the transactions synchronized, across a distributed network of computers.

Blockchain: logically centralized - only one ledger. Organizationally decentralized that ledger is not stored in any one central location. Instead, identical copies on every node.
