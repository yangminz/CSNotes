## Introduction

Network: an infrastructure allows distributed users to communicate with each other. Assumes infra is shared by many users.

Electric Telegraph networks: message switching & store-and-forward operations. Key elements: **Addressing, Routing, Forwarding**.

Inter-net: a network of networks. Connected by using routers & other devices for security, etc. Managed by different organizations.

The Internet: the interconnected set of networks of the **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)**. Objective: diverse applications, devices, infras. An engineered system.

To inter-operate, all participating networks must follow a common set of rules: protocols = interfaces between modules. E.g., address format, header info, packet size limit, etc.

A simple service model: internet: best-effort: packets can get lost.

Some need reliable data delivery, low latency.

-   Horizontally: networks.
-   Vertically: protocols.

Cores

-   Core networking protocols: IP, TCP, Routing
-   Optimization & Perf: QoS, Caching, CNDs, P2P
-   Security, Management
-   IP: The internet, last mile, wireless, data center
-   Infrastructure: Ethernet, WiFi

**Protocol Stacks**

The starting point: telephone network in 1960s. The communication steps:

|                      | No. | Connections            | Actions                                                      |
|----------------------|-----|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Connection set up    | 1   | A -> Telephone network | Pick up phone                                                |
|                      | 2   | A <- Telephone network | Dial tone                                                    |
|                      | 3   | A -> Telephone network | Dial number                                                  |
|                      | 4   | A <- Telephone network | Network selects route; sets up circuit; Called party alerted |
| Information Transfer | 5   | A <-> network <-> B    | Exchange voice signals                                       |
| Connection release   | 6   | A x network x B        | Hang up                                                      |

**Circuit Switching vs Packet Switching**

Src establishes a connection (circuit) to Dst. Each Switch along the path stores infos about the connection, i.e., 2 wires are connected. Then an actual circuit is connected. But the short comings: e.g., burst traffic, idle circuit.

Src sends the info as *self-contained message with address*. Can break up single message to multiple packets. Each packet independently travels to dst. Switches decides the path and do *store-and-forward* like mail system.

Statistical multiplexing: users use packets (fine grain) to share the wires. Links are not idle.

Store-and-Forward architecture:

-   Packets are self contained units
-   Have more paths to choose -- more robust
-   Requries bufferign to absorb bursts

The challenges: congestion, delay.

**Design a large Internet**

Large internet is not more difficult than telephone network.

**Protocols: Enable Communication**

**Protocols** is an agreement between parties on how to communicate. Need to define syntax & semantics. Also break the internet into modules with well-defined interfaces.

---

Regardless of the medium, every network has different bandwidth and latency:

**Bandwidth (capacity)** : width of the link, the number of bits sent or received per unit time (bits/second or bps) 

**Latency (delay)** : length of the link, the propagation time for data to travel along the link (seconds) 

Then the packet delay is

$$Packet Delay = \frac{Data Size}{Link Bandwidth} + Link Latency$$

Use switched network to manage multiple nodes:

**Circuit Switching**: Used in the telephone network

Circuit: The connection established by the interior switches. The circuit would be torn down at last.

Pros: Guaranteed performance and fast transfer (once the circuit is established)

Cons: Waste bandwidth if traffic is bursty (the established circuit idles) and the connection setup time is overhead. The recovery from failure is slow since circuit switching relies on physical machine.

**Packet Switching**: Used in the Internet

Packet: Data be sent as chunks of formatted bits. Packets consist of a header and payload:

**Header**: Instructions to the network for how to handle the packet. Like an envelope.

**Payload**: Data being carried.

Switches forward packets based on their headers, using `Destination -> Next Hop` table to jump to next switch. The switch in the middle waits for the whole packet to arrive. Then it reads and re-sends the packet to the next stop.

Each packet travels independently.

## Local Area Networks, Intra-domain Routing

### Address Schema

#### Media Access Control Address (MAC)

MAC is used as part of Ethernet Protocol. MAC address is 48 bits long, e.g. `34:f3:e4:ae:66:44`. All MAC addresses are assigned by the device manufacturer. Itâ€™s unique to the device (like phone number). 

#### Ethernet Packet

aka **Frame** and **Datagram**. 7 parts:

| Preamble        | SFD      | Destination MAC Address | Source MAC Address | EtherType                  | Payload         | FCS                  |
|-----------------|----------|-------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| 10*56 - 128bits | 10101011 | receiver host           | sender host        | Type of data inside packet | data to be sent | Frame check sequence |

### Routing Algorithm

Address schema + routing algorithm = LAN.

#### Solution 1: Boardcast + Learning Bridges

Boardcast the packet to every switch, while only the receiver server responses. Learning Bridges: Every switch maintains a table: `MAC Address -> Switch Port` - Switch learns: If you want to send a packet to this MAC address, send it on this port.

The learning switch algorithm:

```cs
void OnPacketReceived(RoutingTable table, EthernetPacket packet, int ingressPort)
{
    if (table.HasAddress(packet.SourceMACAddress) == False)
    {
        // Source comes from this port, so it will be sent on this port
        table.AddEntry(packet.SourceMACAddress, ingressPort, DateTime.UtcNow);
    }

    if (table.HasAddress(packet.DestinationMacAddress) == False)
    {
        // Routing Table Miss
        // Boardcast to every egress port
        foreach (int egressPort in table.PortList)
        {
            SendPacket(packet, egressPort);
        }
    }
    else
    {
        // Routing Table Hit
        int egressPort = table.GetPort(packet.DestinationMACAddress);
        SendPacket(packet, egressPort);
    }
}

// SetPeriodicalTimer(() => CleanUp(table, expire), 60 * 10);
void CleanUp(RoutingTable table, long expire)
{
    DateTime utcNow = DateTime.UtcNow;
    for (RoutingEntry entry in table.RoutingEntryList)
    {
        if (utcNow - entry.TimeStamp > expire)
        {
            table.RemoveEntry(entry);
        }
    }
}
```

Pros: Self-Organizing. Hardware and algorithms are fairly simple. Each switch maintains `O(#Hosts)` states.

Cons: Loops or **Boardcast Storm** - boardcast will never die and will accumulate. Use Spanning Tree Algorithm to reduce the topology graph to a tree while all LAN segments are still connected to the LAN.

#### Solution 2: Boardcast + Learning Bridges + Distributed Spanning Tree

Make the graph to a tree to reduce loops. All segments are still connected. Implemented by bridges/switches removing ports. When node/edge fails, rerun to converge to new tree.

Bridge/Switch/Router with lowest MAC address is tree root. Each bridge remembers the port that is on the shortest path to the root. So every switch maintains a data structure: `(Root, PathLength, NextHop)`. The distributed switch/bridge algorithm:

```cs
public class DstRouter
{
    // The root of the tree
    public MacAddress Root;

    // The (shortest) number of switches you have to go through to reach root
    public int PathLength;

    // The switch/node you should forward packets to for them to reach root
    public MacAddress NextHop;
    public int NextHopPort;

    // The MAC address of this node
    public MacAddress DeviceMacAddress;

    // The port list
    public List<int> PortList;

    // ctor
    public DstRouter(MacAddress routerMacAddress, List<int> portList)
    {
        this.Root = routerMacAddress;
        this.PathLength = 0;
        this.NextHop = routerMacAddress;
        this.DeviceMacAddress = routerMacAddress;
        this.PortList = portList;
    }

    public bool OnReceiveUpdate(int port, MacAddress root, int pathLength, MacAddress switchMacAddress)
    {
        bool switchUpdated = false;

        // Listen others' updates
        if (root < this.Root)
        {
            // update to smaller root
            this.Root = root;
            this.PathLength = pathLength + 1;
            this.NextHop = switchMacAddress;
            switchUpdated = true;
        }
        else if (root == this.Root)
        {
            if (pathLength < this.PathLength)
            {
                this.PathLength = pathLength + 1;
                this.NextHop = switchMacAddress;
                this.NextHopPort = port;
                switchUpdated = true;
            }
        }

        // Send current self status to each port
        foreach (int p in this.PortList)
        {
            Send(p, this.Root, this.PathLength, this.DeviceMacAddress);
        }

        return switchUpdated;
    }

    public void OnConverged()
    {
        // remove ports not in path to Root (self and by others)
    }
}
```

When the switches do not receive message any more, the protocol has converged. Not necessarily the shortest path.

#### Solution 3: Distance Vector Algorithm (Routing Information Protocol, RIP)

Boardcast Routing is used in very small networks only, since there is O(Nodes) time cost. In distance vector algorithm, each router maintains its shortest distance to every destination via each of its neighbors. The link distance could be the latency of the link, etc. For example, the topology graph:

|   | to A          | to B | to C | to D          |
|---|---------------|------|------|---------------|
| A | 0 ms          | 1 ms | 1 ms | Not Connected |
| B | 1 ms          | 0 ms | 3 ms | 3 ms          |
| C | 1 ms          | 3 ms | 0 ms | 2 ms          |
| D | Not Connected | 3 ms | 2 ms | 0 ms          |

Then the route table of A will computes the shortest distance to every destination (B, C, D) via any of its neighbors (B and C):

|            | to B | to C | to D |
|------------|------|------|------|
| via Port B | 1 ms | 4 ms | 4 ms |
| via Port C | 4 ms | 1 ms | 3 ms |

Then the min-distance vector of A would be

| to A | to B | to C | to D |
|------|------|------|------|
| 0 ms | 4 ms | 1 ms | 3 ms |

Routers use neighborsâ€™ distance vectors to learn route table, especially when start from a almost empty table. Thatâ€™s to say, router chooses to go to destination via one hop on its neighbor or from the current port directly. Routers exchange their distance vectors with neighbors and update their own routing tables and distance vectors. This process will continue until convergence.

```cs
public class DistVecRouter
{
    // The Distance Vector: Router --> cost
    public HashTable<DistVecRouter, int> DistVec;

    // The Route Table: Router --> Port --> cost
    public HashTable<DistVecRouter, HashTable<int, int>> RouteTable;

    // The Distance Vectors of other switches
    public HashTable<DistVecRouter, HashTable<DistVecRouter, int>> ReceivedVec;

    // The list of ports
    public List<int> PortList;

    // lock phase: all routers send out a DV to neighbors
    public void OnLockPhaseBegin()
    {
        for (DistVecRouter r in this.DistVec.Keys())
        {
            SendDistVec(r, this.DistVec);
        }

        SignalEndLockPhase();
    }

    // update phase: unlocked
    // all routers update tables at the same time
    public void OnUpdatePhaseBegin()
    {
        for (DistVecRouter r in this.DistVec.Keys())
        {
            HashTable<DistVecRouter, int> dv = this.ReceivedVec[r];

            for (int port in this.PortList)
            {
                if (this.RouteTable[router][port] > 1 + dv[router])
                {
                    this.RouteTable[router][port] = 1 + dv[router];

                    // update self distance vector
                    if (this.DistVec[router] > this.RouteTable[router][port])
                    {
                        this.DistVec[router] = this.RouteTable[router][port];
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        SignalEndUpdatePhase();
    }
}
```

In $k^{th}$ round, the routers would get best $(k+1)$-hop paths. The algorithm will converge eventually.

*Trade-Off of the algorithms*

-   **Resilience**: The ability to provide and maintain an acceptable level of service in the face of faults and challenges to normal operation.
-   **Fully Distributed**: Does not assume the previous existence of a central coordinator.
-   **State**: The amount of memory each node uses.
-   **Convergence**: The process of routers agreeing on optimal routes for forwarding packets and thereby completing the updating of their routing table.

Boardcast + Learning Bridges

-   Resilience: Packets are can be received if the route exists
-   Fully Distributed: Yes
-   State per Node: O(Nodes)
-   Convergence: No setup time
-   Routing Efficiency: Boardcast storms
-   Shortest Path: Not necessarily

Boardcast + Learning Bridges + Distributed Spanning Tree

-   Resilience: Need to recompute spanning tree if failure
-   Fully Distributed: Yes
-   State per Node: O(Nodes) + O(Tree Height)
-   Convergence: Run spanning tree protocol before routing
-   Routing Efficiency: Still sends new connections everywhere
-   Shortest Path: Not necessarily

Distance Vector

-   Resilience: Long converge time when link weights increase or when links go down
-   Fully Distributed: Yes
-   State per Node: `O(Nodes) * max{Node Degree}`
-   Convergence: Need to run DV before routing. `O(max{Best Path})`
-   Routing Efficiency: Packets sent directly to their destination
-   Shortest Path: Yes

In Distance Vector algorithm, when link updates happen, e.g. link fails or be more expensive (link latency be higher), loopy routing may exist. This is **Count to Infinity Routing** problem. The root of the problem is that DV algorithm has no way to detect and prevent loops. 

Example, the topology:

```
A -- B: 4
A -- C: 1
B -- C: 50
```

Then for `A` routing table after 1st round updating:

|      | via B | viaC |
|------|-------|------|
| to B | 4     | 51   |
| to C | 54    | 1    |

But `A` can travel to itself: `A -- C -- A -- B` to go to `B` via `C`, `A -- B -- A -- C` to go to `C` via `B`. `A -- B/C -- A` is a loop. Then the global routing table would be:

|      | A     |       |       | B     |       |       | C     |       |       |
|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
|      | via A | via B | via C | via A | via B | via C | via A | via B | via C |
| to A | -     | -     | -     | 4     | -     | 51    | 1     | 50    | -     |
| to B | -     | 4     | 6     | -     | -     | -     | 5     | 54    | -     |
| to C | -     | 9     | 1     | 5     | -     | 50    | -     | -     | -     |


To mitigate the problem, there are three techniques:

-   *Split Horizon/Poison Reverse*: `B` receives distance `4` from `A`, `B` will send distance vector `(to A: infty, to C: 50)` to `A` to cut the reversed path.
-   *Maximum Path Lengths*: Set path length limit to stop from counting forever.
-   *Pushdown Timers*

#### Link State Algorithm (Open Shortest Path First, OSPF)

Every node knows the topology of the whole network by: (1) knowing who they are connected to (neighbors) directly; (2) boardcasts their neighbors; (3) uses a shortest-path algorithm to find the path to destination; (4) build their own routing table.

Use Dijkstra's greedy algorithm to find the shortest path from a source to all other destinations in `O(E + Vlog(V))` time.

A switch has two components:

-   Data Plane: When a packet comes in, data plane reads from a routing table and decides where to send the packet. Then the switch sends the packet out the correct port;
-   Control Plane: What to put into the routing table.

#### Centralized Routing (Software-Defined Networking, SDN)

Instead of boardcasting the neighbors to every other node, all nodes tells a special controller node about their neighborhood topology. Then controller computes best routes for each node.

State of the art. Most people choose this over other designs. Though other algorithms may be more resilient, but they cannot apply policy (exceptions, special cases).
