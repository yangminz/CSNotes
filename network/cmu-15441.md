## Introduction

Network: an infrastructure allows distributed users to communicate with each other. Assumes infra is shared by many users.

Electric Telegraph networks: message switching & store-and-forward operations. Key elements: **Addressing, Routing, Forwarding**.

Inter-net: a network of networks. Connected by using routers & other devices for security, etc. Managed by different organizations.

The Internet: the interconnected set of networks of the **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)**. Objective: diverse applications, devices, infras. An engineered system.

To inter-operate, all participating networks must follow a common set of rules: protocols = interfaces between modules. E.g., address format, header info, packet size limit, etc.

A simple service model: internet: best-effort: packets can get lost.

Some need reliable data delivery, low latency.

-   Horizontally: networks.
-   Vertically: protocols.

**Protocol Stacks**

The starting point: telephone network in 1960s. The communication steps:

|                      | No. | Connections            | Actions                                                      |
|----------------------|-----|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Connection set up    | 1   | A -> Telephone network | Pick up phone                                                |
|                      | 2   | A <- Telephone network | Dial tone                                                    |
|                      | 3   | A -> Telephone network | Dial number                                                  |
|                      | 4   | A <- Telephone network | Network selects route; sets up circuit; Called party alerted |
| Information Transfer | 5   | A <-> network <-> B    | Exchange voice signals                                       |
| Connection release   | 6   | A x network x B        | Hang up                                                      |

**Circuit Switching vs Packet Switching**

Src establishes a connection (circuit) to Dst. Each Switch along the path stores infos about the connection, i.e., 2 wires are connected. Then an actual circuit is connected. But the short comings: e.g., burst traffic, idle circuit.

Src sends the info as *self-contained message with address*. Can break up single message to multiple packets. Each packet independently travels to dst. Switches decides the path and do *store-and-forward* like mail system.

Statistical multiplexing: users use packets (fine grain) to share the wires. Links are not idle.

Store-and-Forward architecture:

-   Packets are self contained units
-   Have more paths to choose -- more robust
-   Requries bufferign to absorb bursts

The challenges: congestion, delay.

**Design a large Internet**

Large internet is not more difficult than telephone network.

**Protocols: Enable Communication**

**Protocols** is an agreement between parties on how to communicate. Need to define syntax & semantics. Also break the internet into modules with well-defined interfaces.

---

Regardless of the medium, every network has different bandwidth and latency:

**Bandwidth (capacity)** : width of the link, the number of bits sent or received per unit time (bits/second or bps) 

**Latency (delay)** : length of the link, the propagation time for data to travel along the link (seconds) 

Then the packet delay is

$$Packet Delay = \frac{Data Size}{Link Bandwidth} + Link Latency$$

Use switched network to manage multiple nodes:

**Circuit Switching**: Used in the telephone network

Circuit: The connection established by the interior switches. The circuit would be torn down at last.

Pros: Guaranteed performance and fast transfer (once the circuit is established)

Cons: Waste bandwidth if traffic is bursty (the established circuit idles) and the connection setup time is overhead. The recovery from failure is slow since circuit switching relies on physical machine.

**Packet Switching**: Used in the Internet

Packet: Data be sent as chunks of formatted bits. Packets consist of a header and payload:

**Header**: Instructions to the network for how to handle the packet. Like an envelope.

**Payload**: Data being carried.

Switches forward packets based on their headers, using `Destination -> Next Hop` table to jump to next switch. The switch in the middle waits for the whole packet to arrive. Then it reads and re-sends the packet to the next stop.

Each packet travels independently.

## Local Area Networks, Intra-domain Routing

### Address Schema

#### Media Access Control Address (MAC)

MAC is used as part of Ethernet Protocol. MAC address is 48 bits long, e.g. `34:f3:e4:ae:66:44`. All MAC addresses are assigned by the device manufacturer. Itâ€™s unique to the device (like phone number). 

#### Ethernet Packet

aka **Frame** and **Datagram**. 7 parts:

| Preamble        | SFD      | Destination MAC Address | Source MAC Address | EtherType                  | Payload         | FCS                  |
|-----------------|----------|-------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| 10*56 - 128bits | 10101011 | receiver host           | sender host        | Type of data inside packet | data to be sent | Frame check sequence |

### Routing Algorithm


A switch has two components:

-   Data Plane: When a packet comes in, data plane reads from a routing table and decides where to send the packet. Then the switch sends the packet out the correct port;
-   Control Plane: What to put into the routing table.

#### Centralized Routing (Software-Defined Networking, SDN)

Instead of boardcasting the neighbors to every other node, all nodes tells a special controller node about their neighborhood topology. Then controller computes best routes for each node.

State of the art. Most people choose this over other designs. Though other algorithms may be more resilient, but they cannot apply policy (exceptions, special cases).
